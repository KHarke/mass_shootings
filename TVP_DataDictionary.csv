AttempttoFlee,Resolution of case,Full,RC,Factor,"A handgun has a short barrel; a shotgun has a long barrel and usually has a smooth bore; a rifle has a long barrel with rifling, which puts spin on the bullet, increasing accuracy and distance; an assault weapon is any semi-automatic gun that can accept a detachable ammunition magazine that has one or more additional features considered useful in military and criminal applications but unnecessary for sports or self-defense, such as a folding, telescoping or thumbhole rifle stock. This is consistent with the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994."
