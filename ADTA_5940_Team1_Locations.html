<h1>Business Problem</h1>
<p>We will work with The Violence Project’s Mass Shooter Database and the purpose of this project is to better understand the underlying factors, patterns, and consequences associated with public mass shootings, which could aid in the development of preventive strategies, interventions, and support for survivors.&nbsp; The data will be examined at three levels: the perpetrator, the victims, and the locations or communities.&nbsp; The desired outcomes will be models of typologies of each of these levels that could be used to generate new research questions, risk assessment models, prevention interventions, and trauma interventions for survivors and witnesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p>We would typically use machine learning algorithms, such as classification models, or bootstrapping to build more data resample with replacement. These will help to build a predictive model for identifying individuals at risk of perpetrating shooting incidents. We could also do a correlation test of mass shooters in Texas to ascertain the gun control level. We are focusing on using unsupervised learning by clustering analysis using age, criminal background, ethnicity, education, etc. to help the policymakers to minimize casualties. Finally, suggestions for future research on the relationship between homicide and the Internet will be considered (Patricia, 2021).&nbsp;</p>

He mentioned a fantasy about going up on top of the tower and shooting people. The psychiatrist noted his rapid mood swings and overwhelming periods of hostility with little provocation.

His obsession with murderers began after JFK was assassinated - he had been Smith's hero.

He only ate canned food because he was paranoid that someone was going to poison him and he thought someone had tapped his telephone line. He felt persecuted by coworkers and bosses, a carpool group which criticized his driving, and his neighbors who he thought burned leaves just to upset him.&nbsp;

He had recently quit his job. Relatives said that he was very affected by racism and had been for years.

He didn't have any friends. He had a history of deep depression.

He was filled with hatred for white people, denounced Christianity, and began to drift from place to place. After the shooting, his apartment walls were discovered to be painted with disjointed hateful statements.

Shortly before the shooting, he experienced hallucinations and was convinced that his coworkers were forcing his second wife to star in pornographic films. His wife left him 6 weeks before the shooting. Some of his coworkers were frightened by his angry outbursts.

After this, he began to have legal troubles and furious arguments with his parents, whom he lived with. He had some psychiatric treatment and was on probation.

He boarded up the doors and windows in his house to ward off evil spirits. In the months before, he also believed his coworkers were trying to poison him.

He charted silver and gold prices, hoarded nonperishable food, applied for Cuban and Soviet citizenship, and assembled an arsenal of weapons. His son feared that if he testified against King, King would kill him.

He avoided all social interactions and planned to walk ten hours to get to his father's house. Once at his father's house, he believed "the enemy" was closing in on him and shot his neighbors. His mother had died a few months before.

He had also recently been banned from making deliveries to a certain customer, as they called him a troublemaker.&nbsp;

His wife left him when he wouldn't get psychiatric help and eventually he was suspended from his teaching position. Two days before the shooting, he found out that he was not going to be allowed to return to teaching in the fall. He had delusions of grandeur and was paranoid. The day before the shooting, he argued with repair shop employees over a bill and left muttering threats - he returned the next day and shot them.

He planned to kill his wife on the night of the shooting.&nbsp;

He had been banned from a bar about 2 months before for violence.

He was worried about layoffs. He was suspended on the morning of the shooting for talking to his wife and arguing with supervisors.

The day before the shooting, he told someone that he had to get out of the post office.&nbsp;

He got very angry at the children of the neighborhood for being near his house and threatened them with his gun.&nbsp;

She had applied for a temporary restraining order against him and there was supposed to be a hearing to make it permanent the day after the shooting.&nbsp;

He was distraught over his pregnant wife leaving him 2 weeks earlier. He was agitated, paranoid, repeatedly ran into the road to "moon" passing cars, and fired a rifle into the air in the day before the shooting.

He had PTSD from fighting in Vietnam and had been shot in the head a few years before the shooting. The day before the shooting, he was in an unusually good mood and planned to be baptized that weekend.&nbsp;

He told his brother about his desire to massacre people.&nbsp;

He threatened to get even with the company. His grandmother died a month earlier. He believed there were conspiracies against him and seemed disoriented in the weeks before the shooting, after his medication had been changed. Without his job, he became isolated and angry.

His wife got a restraining order and his car was repossessed a few months before the shooting. He became isolated from friends.

He was seen screaming at a woman shortly after, and threatened a convenience store clerk because he believed people were going to his house. On the morning of the shooting, he was unusually friendly and calm as he made his customary convenience store breakfast purchase.&nbsp;

He felt cheated because another student had won a prestigious department prize. His temper scared people.

Three weeks before he was involuntarily discharged from the program because he hit or threatened a nurse. His estranged wife thought he might have killed himself a week before the shooting.&nbsp;

Six days before the shooting, he lost an arbitration hearing, making his firing from the post office final.

Three months before, he lost his job due to not having a high school diploma. His girlfriend left him shortly before the shooting. In the two months before the shooting, he began hearing voices and hallucinating. He talked about committing violence with a friend.

The day before the shooting, he went to the social services office and told them he wasn't the father. A manager told him to get a lawyer and he said if he had to get a lawyer, he would just kill himself.

Six months before the shooting, he was evicted and his wife left him, taking their infant daughter with her. He left a suicide note where he referred to himself as Jesse Cole Younger and damned the American family to hell.

Acquaintances noted that he was strange and secretive. A note found after his death revealed paranoia of a conspiracy targeting him.&nbsp;

He called his mother crying about the abuse she and his sister faced from his father. His mother was very concerned about him. He went to a party where he was hyperactive, erratic, and told children to shoot and kill Black people. Friends were alarmed by his odd behavior and he told them his sister had been raped by Black men.&nbsp;

He had struggled with an inability to get a job for years, becoming isolated and paranoid that the company he had previously worked for was sabotaging his job prospects.

For years he had been obsessed with racism and believed it was the cause of all his failures. A few weeks before the shooting, his landlord told him to move out. In the two weeks before the shooting, his landlord noticed he was uncharacteristically calm and became very concerned that he would kill himself.

He fired guns into the air to scare officials off his property and was verbally abusive and threatening to them. He blamed the city officials for his wife’s cancer death. His behavior frightened one town official so much that she started carrying a pistol around with her.&nbsp;

He told someone he felt like killing that business partner.

Friends noticed him becoming embittered and distressed before the shooting. He likely threatened and harassed the boss who fired him. On the day of the shooting, his parents noticed he was pale, agitated, and nervous. He had not told his family that he had been fired or that he had been let go from his new job a week before.

Other coworkers noted that he was withdrawn and unfriendly in the week before the shooting. He looked sickly and lost weight. He was fighting to get paid more for the work he was doing and had been on stress-related medical leave for the past four months. He was upset that he had been passed over for a promotion. He had been severely depressed and attempted suicide in the last year.

He claimed to be a gang member. He did not seem to have close friends.

The day he shot his parents, he was charged with two felonies for buying a stolen gun in school. He wrote that he could not face telling his parents about the charges so he shot them instead.&nbsp;He also heard voices.

He was distraught that his wife was leaving him and blamed her for losing his job. He had been involuntarily committed several times in the eight months before the shooting and diagnosed as psychotic and suicidal.

He was depressed, short-tempered and withdrawn from family, and got into trouble at school for the first time in his life. He was arrested for breaking into a van and stealing equipment, and got uncharacteristically angry at his mother. He turned in school assignments with violent imagery. He went to counseling and seemed to be doing better.

His parents put him on antidepressants and had him see a therapist. He began to express violent thoughts in school projects and to his friends, and got into trouble for creating a website threatening his classmate. He enjoyed making bombs. Five days before the shooting, he found out he could not join the Marines due to his antidepressant use, which was crushing to him.

He had been fired a few weeks earlier after missing shifts and "acting differently."
74                                                                                                                                                                                                           He had been paranoid for 14 years - he used to tape his employees’ phone calls because he thought they were talking about him. He had always been abusive and was the only suspect in the murder of his first wife and mother-in-law. A few months before the shooting, he was upset so he killed his daughter’s cat to make himself feel better. In the days leading up to the shooting he was depressed, had lost large amounts of money, and changed his will twice.

He destroyed his house before the shooting - punching holes in walls, pouring cement into toilets, etc. He sent a letter to a local newspaper where he described a CIA conspiracy, fears that he was a murder suspect, and beliefs that police were drugging him. Before this, he had always been known to neighbors as scary, abused his father, and had been arrested for drug charges.&nbsp;

He was paranoid and believed that his coworkers had killed his pet fish and were sabotaging his work. He was afraid he would lose his job if he couldn't master a new training. He saw dark shadows when trying to sleep. He heard voices and threatened his coworkers.

He believed his face was badly scarred, that the FBI was monitoring him, and that he was harassed by strangers on a trip abroad. He lived with his parents and was unable to function in a job.
80                        Less than two weeks before the shooting, he was informed that his paychecks would be garnished by the IRS. This was very upsetting to him and he insisted he would not give them any money. A few days before the shooting he was informed that his car would be repossessed. He then had three coworkers witness the signing of his will. The day before the shooting was Christmas, and his family did not see any signs of trouble. On the morning of the shooting, he seemed friendly and normal. He claimed to have had a psychotic break where he believed he was being time-traveled back to Nazi Germany to kill Hitler, instead of his coworkers.

He believed his wife was having an affair with the supplier for their store, and accused the supplier of wrecking his business. Friends thought that these accusations were unfounded and were just the result of mental problems.

He had a recurring delusion that he was Michael the Archangel and he was on a mission to rid the world of wicked people. He was witnessed doing other bizarre things indicative of psychosis shortly before the shooting.

After being suspended, he threatened violence, and his supervisors were so concerned by the threats that they notified the FBI.&nbsp;

Shortly before the shooting, he was afraid he would lose his job. 34 years before, he had planned to kidnap his child and commit a mass shooting from a clock tower.

Immediately before the shooting, he got into an argument over $20 and a CD player.&nbsp;He was unemployed and seeking a job.

He was known to have anger management issues.&nbsp;He felt like everybody was against him and that he was ignored when he asked for help from his supervisors.

Six months later, he was fired for "ten different reasons," including inconsistently showing up to work. In the six months before the shooting, he would call his old workplace and leave drunken ramblings on their answering machines. He had threatened at least one of his former bosses.

He had a drinking problem, lost his job, and was homeless and living in a camper. His girlfriend's father was worried about him and told Reeves to get some help, and had been especially worried that Reeves would do something irrational on the day of the shooting.

The night before the shooting, his son noticed that his father seemed dull and sad.&nbsp;

He believed that his favorite band, Pantera, had stolen song lyrics from him, talked about killing people, said that God told him to kill Marilyn Manson, petted an imaginary dog, and stared at walls while talking to himself. About a year before, he had been discharged early from the Marines after being diagnosed with schizophrenia.

He seemed angry at the church's teachings and prediction of an upcoming apocalypse. His temp job was coming to an end soon.

Shortly before the shooting, he was switched from attending classes to studying at home with a teacher to help with his "issues."&nbsp;
96                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             For several years, he had been abrasive and occasionally threatened his neighbors with obscenities and guns. Six months before the shooting, he became very reclusive and hardly ever left his house.
97                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A few years before the shooting, she was given early retirement due to her psychosis. She talked to imaginary people, took her clothes off in public, had bizarre business ideas, and had to be carried out of the post office by police officers once.
98                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         His brother noticed that he withdrew from life in the months before the shooting. He did not have friends or a steady job in Seattle. He became obsessed with rave culture and delusionally believed it was "raping" him.

His wife had just left him.

Right before the shooting, he called his wife to say goodbye. He had periodic bouts of depression for twenty years following the death of his firstborn child shortly after she was born. He had always been a bit isolated and not particularly social. In the week before the shooting he actually seemed unusually comfortable in social situations where he was normally awkward.&nbsp;

He displayed violent behaviors and writings, refused to speak in class, told his roommates about his supermodel alien girlfriend, threatened suicide, and stalked several female classmates. Five months before, he was court-ordered to get outpatient mental health treatment.

He had anger issues, threatened violence against his stepmother, and was severely depressed. His parents gave up custody of him to the state when their insurance would not pay for any more treatment. In the days before the shooting, he lost his job at McDonald’s and broke up with a girlfriend. The night before the shooting, his mother had dinner with him and claimed to sense that something was wrong with him.&nbsp;

He had recently lost his job. He had always been socially awkward with a bad temper.

He protested outside of buildings and disrupted city council meetings. He had thousands of dollars in fines which the city were prepared to waive if he just stopped bothering them. He filed a civil rights lawsuit against the city and lost a few days before the shooting - it had been his last hope. He had massive debts and had previously become extremely angry and shoved someone who asked him to stop protesting. A few days before the shooting, he seemed depressed.

He became isolated from the only place he had ever felt accepted when he was reprimanded for an inappropriate post on an NIU message board. Three weeks before the shooting, he stopped taking his antidepressant medication because it made him feel like a zombie.

He had stopped taking his medication three months before the shooting. He believed the victims were Mafia members planning to kill him. Immediately before the shooting, he called his family’s lawyer and asked if he would defend Leeds if he had to do something to defend himself.

He called his girlfriend and threatened to kill the supervisor. He hit a coworker while they were on a break, causing his supervisor to reprimand him again. He believed he would be fired.

He was under community supervision for petty crimes. A week before the shooting, his parents had told him he couldn’t sleep in their home anymore. Three days before the shooting, he agreed to get a mental health evaluation for the first time. After the shooting, he claimed that God had told him to kill evil.

She noted that he was in an unstable mental state after she left and she believed he would try to kill her. He had threatened her with a gun a week before the shooting.&nbsp;

He had always been quiet but became more so in the two weeks before the shooting - he stopped eating dinner and watching TV, and would rarely leave his bedroom.&nbsp;

He openly struggled between the duties of his military job and his religion.

He believed that he was Jesus Christ, that he had been cursed, that his wife could get $37 billion from an online church, and that he could fly and would save the world. He thought the criminal justice system was conspiring against him.

He repeatedly told her everything was okay. When he got to work he was shown video evidence of his theft from the company and was forced to resign.

He was suspended from college, lost his friends, challenged basic facts and societal norms, and scared his teachers and classmates. He had a short temper and was very erratic.&nbsp;
121                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 In the days before the shooting, he had been depressed and had trouble sleeping. He was grieving the loss of a family member. He had unusual behaviors, like removing all of the batteries from the clocks in his house because the ticking sound bothered him.&nbsp;
122                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                He feared that demons were after him. He talked to a priest about it and said that the voices were telling him to do bad things.&nbsp;

He and his wife were getting divorced and were locked in a bitter custody battle. He threatened to kill his wife and held a gun to her head.

He dropped out of school. He had debt from old unpaid rent, and he was angry that the university would not refund his tuition. He was withdrawn and felt that other students had made fun of his poor English, though that was unlikely since most of them were not native speakers.

He was asked to leave a café due to belligerent behavior in front of elderly customers a week before, and when he went back he was again asked to leave and then began shooting. People did not want to associate with him due to his odd behavior. He told his girlfriend that he was a married father of six and others that he was on a CIA death squad. On the morning of the shooting he was in an unusually good mood.

In the months before, he had stopped smiling and joking in class. He told a classmate that he wanted to kill people when his life was over. He suddenly quit the graduate program after doing very poorly on his oral exams. He thought that he could add to the value of his own life by killing others. He told a psychiatrist that he was thinking about killing people.

He stopped speaking to his parents two years before the shooting. Immediately before the shooting, he was fired for chronic tardiness.&nbsp;

He became obsessed with mass murderers and discussed them online. In the years leading up to the shooting, he blacked out the windows in his room and would only communicate with his mother through email. He was malnourished to the point of possible brain damage. His mother was planning for them to move and the prospect was very stressful for him.&nbsp;

An old boss saw him three months before the shooting and was surprised when Myers would not even engage in conversation. His family had not had contact with him in years. He was in debt and being harassed by debt collectors.

He had anger issues for years and had been abusive to his partners.&nbsp;
132                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Years before, he was given psychiatric treatment after looking up assault weapons in school. He told friends he wanted to hurt people. Neighbors often heard him screaming and cursing.&nbsp;
133                                                                                                                                                                                                 Three days before the shooting, he was deposed in a lawsuit because he had been sending abusive emails to former coworkers. He admitted to sending them and apologized hours before the shooting. He then called 911 to report that he was being targeted and that an attorney was casting witchcraft on him. His mother also called 911 and said he needed a psychological exam. In the days before the shooting, he withdrew from a neighbor who he was usually friendly with.
134                                                                                                                   In the months leading up to the shooting, he withdrew from his friends, had insomnia, damaged his friend's car by putting sugar in the gas tank, and was noticeably depressed. He called police to report that he was hearing voices from the ceiling of his hotel room, that he was being followed by three people, that they were using a microwave machine to send vibrations to control him, and they prevented him from falling asleep. He sought help at the VA hospital and reported that he was still being followed by people who wanted to hurt him.

She had recently been replaced as chairwoman by her brother. On the day of the shooting, the tribal council was holding a hearing to evict her from her house on tribal land, a very serious punishment. A neighbor said she had always been a bully.

He posted videos online that concerned his mother and caused police to perform a wellness check. He had always been withdrawn and friendless. He believed that he was perfect and deserved to have a beautiful girlfriend and that women as a whole conspired against him to make him miserable. He had delusions of grandeur.

He broke up with his girlfriend that weekend, who said he had a shorter fuse with her than was normal, and sent her many suicidal texts afterwards. He had trouble adjusting to high school and was not participating in classes. His Twitter posts were also of a distraught and suicidal nature. His friends noticed rapid mood swings.&nbsp;

A few months before the shooting, he was arrested for possession of Suboxone and banned from the local mall. Friends heard him making racist comments. He documented his new beliefs in racial conspiracy theories.

He was upset about a recent DUI arrest and felt very conflicted about his drug use and his religion. He had been depressed and suicidal for awhile.&nbsp;

He was withdrawn and quiet with no friends. Shortly before the shooting, he wrote a manifesto talking about how he had always been the most hated person in the world and how he admired Elliot Rodger. In the month before the shooting, he began urinating in a bucket in his bedroom instead of using the bathroom.&nbsp;

Neighbors knew him to be moody and drink until he passed out. He was upset about the sale of "his" family land to the victims of the shooting, which happened 3 months before the shooting.

He told a friend that it was "getting out of hand."&nbsp;

A month before, relatives noticed that he changed, and said he lost his mind and was hallucinating.&nbsp;

He threatened his wife and tried to force her to sign nonexistent divorce papers. He had money issues and was very angry about having to pay child support. The day before the shooting, legal action to garnish his wages began.

He was broke and rent was due soon.

In the months before the shooting, he seemed slightly depressed. His girlfriend thought he was going to break up with her.&nbsp;A friend (Jim Nixon) had sense Paddock had bad intentions years before, and sent him letters pleading for him not to do something terrible.

He had threatened his mother-in-law and continued to be controlling of his wife.

The day before the shooting, he called his mother and told her it was all over and he had done everything he could to fight against the people in his neighborhood. His sister said they got calls like that for 20 years and it did not especially concern them. His sister said his mental health “continually deteriorated” over the last year especially.

He left gifts on her car, bought her flowers when she was sick, and was jealous when she began dating someone else. She made a Facebook post saying that she needed to get taken out, either on a date or by a sniper - he replied that he could do both.

He was violent toward a family who took him in after her death, and threatened to bring his gun to their house. Someone reported to police that he was stockpiling weapons and could be a potential school shooter. Someone else called the FBI and told them that Cruz was "going to explode," a month before the shooting. He said that he wanted to kill people in his Instagram posts.

He kicked his wife out of their home before the divorce was finalized, sent her divorce papers in a language she couldn't read, and suddenly broke down crying when discussing her with a neighbor.&nbsp;

He did not have any friends.

Immediately before the shooting he was fired for workplace rule violations. He had previous convictions for domestic violence.

He became too upset to discuss the issue and offered to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket instead of trying to work it out. His email drafts showed irrational and suspicious beliefs. He had insomnia. About six months before, he stopped communicating with his mother and ex-wife. On the day of the shooting, he resigned from his job.

She had grown afraid of him after he tried to give another ex-girlfriend a threatening letter. He told her he had nearly committed suicide twice before.

He had threatened his neighbor with a gun a few weeks before. He had previously been adjudicated mentally defective.

Ten years before the shooting, he was arrested for assaulting and threatening to kill a girlfriend. For at least a few years before the shooting, he became involved with the Black Hebrew Israelites and believed that Jewish people were imposters.

A neighbor described the change as being like "Jekyll and Hyde." Neighbors heard her and Anderson chanting at night, she stopped working, became isolated and unfriendly, and was evicted from her condo after not paying the mortgage. They became homeless and lived in a van.

He also told his neighbor that spies were following him around to make sure he wasn't faking an injury to get worker's compensation. He had an ongoing dispute with a coworker.

On the night of the shooting, he talked on the phone with his mother and worried her by asking if she had been "infiltrated." She planned to come see him the next day because she was concerned for his mental health. He also had been isolating himself from his online group of friends in the two days before the shooting, which was very unusual.

In 2017, he attacked a classmate after alleged racist taunts. After losing a wresting match in 2018, he threatened to kill his teammates. After graduating high school in 2018, he withdrew from social activities. He had become even more isolated in the last year.

An ex-girlfriend said he had violent mood swings, alcohol problems, was sexually abusive, and did not treat his bipolar disorder.

<p>We want to join the data on state and year to gain insights into state population and the state firearms laws in a given time period. The population estimates were downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/JoshData/historical-state-population-csv" class="uri">https://github.com/JoshData/historical-state-population-csv</a>, which were originally from the U.S. Census. The firearms laws data was extracted from the <a href="https://www.statefirearmlaws.org/resources">State Firearms Law Database</a>, originally created for a research project. The key data point extracted from this set is the total number of <em>restrictive</em> firearms laws for the state and effective year of the mass shooting event. The main limitation of this data is that it only covers the period from 1991 through 2021.</p>
<p>Both of these data will be merged with the Full_Dataset based on both State and Year. NOTE: the State Firearms Law Database has already been matched against the state and year prior to being added to this R Project. Hence, this extracted dataset will be matched based on the case number.EDA</p>
